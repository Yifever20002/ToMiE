In this paper, we highlight a critical yet often overlooked factor in most 3D human tasks, namely modeling humans with complex garments. It is known that the parameterized formulation of SMPL is able to fit human skin; while complex garments, e.g., hand-held objects and loose-fitting garments, are difficult to get modeled within the unified framework, since their movements are usually decoupled with the human body. To enhance the capability of SMPL skeleton in response to this situation, we propose a modular growth strategy that enables the joint tree of the skeleton to expand adaptively. Specifically, our method, called ToMiE, consists of parent joints localization and external joints optimization. For parent joints localization, we employ a gradient-based approach guided by both LBS blending weights and motion kernels. Once the external joints are obtained, we proceed to optimize their transformations in SE(3) across different frames, enabling rendering and explicit animation. ToMiE manages to outperform other methods across various cases with garments, not only in rendering quality but also by offering free animation of grown joints, thereby enhancing the expressive ability of SMPL skeleton for a broader range of applications.

### `Download SMPL model`

Copy the smpl model.

    SMPL_DIR=/path/to/smpl

    MODEL_DIR=$SMPL_DIR/smplify_public/code/models

    cp $MODEL_DIR/basicModel_neutral_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl third_parties/smpl/models

    VGG_DIR=/path/to/vgg.pth

    cp $VGG_DIR third_parties/lpips/weights/v0.1/

### `Download RAFT model`
    cd RAFT && ./download_models.sh

## B. Experiments on I3D-Human Dataset
The I3D-Human Dataset focuses on capturing variations in clothing appearance under approximately identical poses. Compared with existing benchmarks, we outfit the subjects in loose clothing such as dresses and light jackets and
encourage movements involving acceleration or deceleration, such as sudden stops
after spinning, swaying, and flapping sleeves. Our capturing equipment consists of
10 DJI Osmo Action cameras, shooting at a frame rate of 100fps while synchronized
with an audio signal. The final processed dataset records 10k frames of sequence
from 6 subjects in total. Click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bj1pmr_FZE5ClR5ZCWpXD79ESaM8Ivvg?usp=sharing) to download our I3D-Human Dataset and copy it to /path/to/Dyco's parent/dataset/.
